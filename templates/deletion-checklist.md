# Deletion Checklist

## Files and Code Ranges to Remove After Migration

The following files and code ranges should be deleted after the corresponding migration phase is complete and verified. Always run the full test suite before and after each deletion.

| # | File Path | Line Range | Reason | Phase |
|---|-----------|:----------:|--------|:-----:|
{{#each migrationPlan.deletionChecklist}}
| {{@index}} | `{{filePath}}` | {{#if lineRange}}L{{lineRange.start}}–{{lineRange.end}}{{else}}Entire file{{/if}} | {{reason}} | — |
{{/each}}

## Estimated Impact

- **Total files affected**: {{filesToDelete.length}}
- **Estimated lines saved**: {{linesSavedEstimate}}

## Deletion Procedure

For each item in the checklist:

- [ ] **1. Verify migration is complete** — Confirm the replacement library is fully integrated and tested
- [ ] **2. Run test suite** — Ensure all tests pass before deletion
- [ ] **3. Search for references** — Grep for imports/requires of the file to ensure no remaining consumers
- [ ] **4. Delete the file or code range** — Remove the specified lines or entire file
- [ ] **5. Run test suite again** — Confirm no regressions after deletion
- [ ] **6. Commit with descriptive message** — Reference the migration phase and recommendation number

## Safety Notes

- **Never delete before migrating** — Each deletion is tied to a specific recommendation. Only delete after that recommendation's migration step is verified.
- **Adapter strategies first** — For high-risk items with adapter strategies, the adapter must be in place and tested before the legacy code is removed.
- **Incremental deletion** — Delete one file at a time and verify. Do not batch-delete across phases.
- **Keep backups** — Ensure the code is committed to version control before deletion so it can be recovered if needed.
