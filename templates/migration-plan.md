# Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased migration plan for replacing hand-rolled implementations with recommended third-party libraries. Phases are ordered by risk level: low-risk quick wins first, followed by medium-risk refactoring, and finally high-risk changes requiring adapter strategies.

## Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Review all recommendations and verify they align with project goals
- [ ] Ensure CI/CD pipeline has adequate test coverage for affected modules
- [ ] Create feature branches for each phase
- [ ] Set up rollback procedures for each phase
- [ ] Communicate migration timeline to the team

## Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Run full test suite after each phase
- [ ] Verify no regressions in affected functionality
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new library usage
- [ ] Remove deprecated code per the deletion checklist
- [ ] Update dependency lock files
- [ ] Perform load testing if performance-critical paths were changed

## Rollback Strategy

If a phase introduces regressions:

1. Revert the feature branch merge
2. If an adapter strategy was used, the adapter layer provides a clean rollback point
3. Re-run the test suite to confirm rollback is clean
4. Investigate the regression before re-attempting the phase
